Unitec Creative Industries & Business is a fluid-width, three-column theme for Moodle 2.2.

NB: While the theme is for Moodle 2.2, the version.php file contains
the information for lowering this requirement. Theme has not been
tested in 2.0 or 2.1, so doing so is currently at your own risk. My
aim is to have this theme fully compatible with all versions of
Moodle 2.
