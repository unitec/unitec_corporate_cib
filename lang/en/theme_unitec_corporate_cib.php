The custom menu contains a My courses link, which appears after any administrator-added items. This is a greyscale version of that theme.</p><h2>Tweaks</h2><p>This theme is built upon Base, a parent theme included in the Moodle core. If you want to modify Unitec Creative Industries & Business, we recommend that you first duplicate it then rename it before making your changes. This means you\'ll still have the original files if you make a mistake. More information on modifying themes can be found in the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Theme">MoodleDocs</a>.</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>This theme was coded and is maintained by Unitec New Zealand.
